A business sells 3D Printers and they want a website.

This is the system I follow:

    Find out if the business has an existing website
    Find out what their competitors are doing that they aren't doing
    See if the business has active AdWords campaigns
    See how the business ranks on Google (SEO)
    See if the business has social media profiles
    Find out how much the average 3D printer costs
    Find out how many printers the business sells every month
